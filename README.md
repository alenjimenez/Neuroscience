The aim of this project is to analyse data generated by a brainwave sensor. A student at ITBA (Technological Institute of Buenos Aires) volunteered to wear a sensor on her head while engaging in various behaviors. The sensor measured the oscillations of brainwaves during the execution of these behaviors and computed time series representing them.

Nine behaviors were measured: keeping eyes open, keeping eyes closed, constant blinking, nodding the head while saying yes, shaking the head while saying no, answering a series of questions truthfully, answering the same series of questions with lies, and, finally, meditating. Brainwaves were measured for each behavior for 1 minute, except for meditation, which lasted 2 minutes.

I perfomed two excersises:
1. Perform statistical analysis of the series, including the application of multiple filters.
2. Applying Machine Learning models to predict one behavior in relation to another based on the information that could be extracted from the time series. The behaviors we are going to try to distinguish from each other are keeping the eyes open (baseline, target = 0) and blinking (target = 1).
